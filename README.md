# Snap

This project was given to my during my _nology course and my task was to model a card game - Snap using the Java language and my knowledge of OOP.
The brief had 4 stages:
- To create a Card class, and then create methods to create a deck of cards.
- Create methods to deal a card, shuffle the deck and sort the decks - either by their symbol or suit.
- Create a Snap class that allows the user to play the Snap card game
- Make the game two player, add scores and also make sure the user types in snap within 2 seconds to get a successful snap.
